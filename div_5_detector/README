Description of design is located in header of SystemVerilog design file.

Freely available tools required to compile, simulate, and view waveform for this RTL sample:
    1. Compile and simulate: Icarus Verilog (http://iverilog.icarus.com)
    2. View waveform:        GTKWave (http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net)

To compile and simulate:
